console.log("This is tuto68");

// command lines at the terminal:

// node --version  : It tells the version of the node package
// NPM(Node Package Manager)

// npm --version : It tells the version of the node package manager

// npm init : it asks several questions like the package nam, version, description, entry point, keyword, author, etc. When we execute this, there is a new file called package.json inside the tut68 directory. 

// npm install slugify:  If by mistake this folder gets deleted, we can recover it back by again installing npm by writing npm install.

// npm install slugify@1.3.5

// npm install nodemon --save-dev : It will be saved in dev dependencies
